# Creating a Pull Request

Hey there!

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Sabayon! Very appreciated!

Keep in mind, that you should adhere to the following commit message convention
if you want to add a new package to SCR:

`[scr-target] Action category/package::overlay`

For example:

`[community] Add app-editors/atom-bin::jorgicio`

scr-target must be one of the directories in the root of this repository.

action must be either `Add`, `Remove`, `Drop`, `Unpin` or `Rename`.


Thanks for taking the time :-)
