## Most of the configurations are optional, just build.target and repository.description are required.
repository:
# REPOSITORY Definition. It contains the description and option regarding your entropy repository.
   description: My testing repository # REQUIRED!!!
   # This is your repository description.
   maintenance:
     check_diffs: 0 # disable diffs checking from binhost. Result: always inject stuff into repository
     clean_cache: 1
     #USE WITH CAUTION! it will wipe your cache and it is VERY slow! it's like starting the building process for the first time.
     keep_previous_versions: 1
     # Set this value to the numbers of package versions that you want to keep.
     # e.g. if you have different versions of app/foo: app/foo-1, app/foo-2, this is the number of them you may want to keep in your repository.
     # When there are more version than the number specified, the older gets removed automatically. Defaults to 1
     remove:
       - app-foo/bar
       - app-misc/baz-1.2
     # Packages that you may want to remove manually from the repository
build:
# BUILD Definition. It contains description and options regarding your emerge build.

      # How much have to deep the dependency scanner to get your deps
      prune_virtuals: 1
      # Remove packages that satisfy a virtual dependency from the list of packages
      # to install using entropy.
      install_version : 0

  ## Advanced options below:
  docker:

    # Docker image to use as building environment. defaults to sabayon/builder-amd64
    entropy_image: sabayon/eit-amd64
    # Docker image to use as repository environment. defaults to sabayon/eit-amd64
  emerge:
  # Gentoo users will recognize those options, if not familiar, leave as default
    default_args: -t
    # Emerge default arguments.
    # You can specify further options to give to emerge here
    split_install: 1
    # If set to 1, calls emerge for each package instead in one single call.

    profile: 3
    # Gentoo Profile to use
    jobs: 4

    preserved_rebuild: 0
    # Run emerge of preserved libs after build
    skip_sync: 1
