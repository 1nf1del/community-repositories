## Most of the configurations are optional, just build.target and repository.description are required.
repository:
# REPOSITORY Definition. It contains the description and option regarding your entropy repository.
   description: My testing repository # REQUIRED!!!
   # This is your repository description.
   maintenance:
     clean_cache: 1
     #USE WITH CAUTION! it will wipe your cache and it is VERY slow! it's like starting the building process for the first time.
     keep_previous_versions: 1
     # Set this value to the numbers of package versions that you want to keep.
     # e.g. if you have different versions of app/foo: app/foo-1, app/foo-2, this is the number of them you may want to keep in your repository.
     # When there are more version than the number specified, the older gets removed automatically. Defaults to 1
     remove:
       - app-foo/bar
       - app-misc/baz-1.2
     # Packages that you may want to remove manually from the repository
build:
# BUILD Definition. It contains description and options regarding your emerge build.
  overlays:
    - mrueg
    - games-overlay
  # Adds the specified overlays with layman before build
  target: # REQUIRED!!!
    - app-text/tree
    - dev-lang/php
  # The packages you wish to compile and be added to the entropy repository
  equo:
    repositories:
      - community
    # Use enman to add the repositories before the build
    package:
      install:
        - app-text/tree
        - app-misc/foo
      # List here the packages that you might want installed with Entropy official repositories before starting the build
      remove:
        - whatever
      # List here the packages that you might want removed before the build
    repository: main
    # You can build against main (sabayonlinux.org) or weekly. It is strongly encouraged to keep default
    dependency_install:
      enable: 1
      # Enable/disable equo to install package dependencies (automatically detected)
      install_atoms: 1
      # Require to install the atoms of the dependencies, not their version
      dependency_scan_depth: 2 #DEPENDENCY_SCAN_DEPTH
      # How much have to deep the dependency scanner to get your deps
      install_version : 0
      # Install versions instead of atoms with equo. Discouraged
      split_install: 1
      # Install packages calling equo install separately
  ## Advanced options below:
  docker:
    image: sabayon/builder-amd64
    # Docker image to use as building environment. defaults to sabayon/builder-amd64
    entropy_image: sabayon/eit-amd64
    # Docker image to use as repository environment. defaults to sabayon/eit-amd64
  emerge:
  # Gentoo users will recognize those options, if not familiar, leave as default
    default_args: -t
    # Emerge default arguments.
    # You can specify further options to give to emerge here
    split_install: 1
    # If set to 1, calls emerge for each package instead in one single call.
    features: parallel -userpriv
    # features to enable/disable to your build
    profile: 3
    # Gentoo Profile to use
    jobs: 4
    # Package compilation/installations in parallel (this is NOT MAKEOPTS's -j)
    preserved_rebuild: 0
    # Run emerge of preserved libs after build
    skip_sync: 1
    # skip portage sync
    webrsync: 1
    # uses webrsync instead of emerge --sync
    remote_overlay: https://github.com/my/repo
    # Specify a github/bitbucket/whatever.git repository to clone and use as local_overlay during the build (it overrides local_overlay which can be used in the git repo)
